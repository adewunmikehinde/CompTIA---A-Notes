# ðŸ“˜ CompTIA A+ â€“ Common Network Ports (Lesson 10)

This note summarizes the **most common network ports**, their purpose, default numbers, and easy-to-remember analogies. Perfect for exam prep and quick revision.

## What is a Network Port?

A **network port** is like a **door on your computer** that allows data to enter or leave. Each door has a **number** (port number), and different types of data use different doors.

**Analogy:**  
- Computer = hotel  
- IP address = hotel building  
- Port number = room number  
- Data = guest  

Example:  
- HTTP traffic â†’ port 80 â†’ lobby  
- HTTPS traffic â†’ port 443 â†’ VIP secure lounge  

Ports allow the computer to **route incoming and outgoing traffic to the correct service**.

## Common Network Ports

| Port / Protocol | Purpose | Analogy | Fixed/Standard? |
|----------------|---------|--------|----------------|
| **FTP** 20/21 | Transfer files | Room 21 = front desk (control), Room 20 = storage room (data) | âœ… Yes |
| **SSH** 22 | Secure remote login | VIP private entrance | âœ… Yes |
| **Telnet** 23 | Remote login (not secure) | Back door anyone can peek through | âœ… Yes |
| **SMTP** 25 | Send emails | Mailroom for outgoing letters | âœ… Yes |
| **DNS** 53 | Translate domain names â†” IP | Hotel receptionist giving room numbers | âœ… Yes |
| **DHCP** 67/68 | Assign IP addresses automatically | Front desk giving room keys | âœ… Yes |
| **HTTP** 80 | Web browsing (unencrypted) | Lobby | âœ… Yes |
| **HTTPS** 443 | Secure web browsing | VIP secure lounge | âœ… Yes |
| **POP3** 110 | Download emails | Picking up mail from mailbox | âœ… Yes |
| **IMAP4** 143 | Access/manage emails on server | Checking mailbox from anywhere | âœ… Yes |
| **SMB** 137/139/445 | File & printer sharing | Shared kitchen/printer room | âœ… Yes |
| **SNMP** 161/162 | Monitor/manage network devices | Hotel manager checking stats & alerts | âœ… Yes |
| **LDAP** 389 | Directory info of users/devices | Hotel directory of guests & rooms | âœ… Yes |
| **RDP** 3389 | Remote desktop access | Control lights/TV in hotel room remotely | âœ… Yes |

## Detailed Explanations

### 1. FTP â€“ File Transfer Protocol
- **Ports:** TCP 20 (data), TCP 21 (control)  
- **Use:** Transfers files between computers. Supports authentication or anonymous login.  
- **Analogy:** Front desk (control) manages requests; storage room moves the actual files.  

### 2. SSH â€“ Secure Shell
- **Port:** TCP 22  
- **Use:** Secure remote login, encrypted communication.  
- **Analogy:** VIP private entrance for trusted guests only.  

### 3. Telnet
- **Port:** TCP 23  
- **Use:** Remote login, sends data in clear text (not secure).  
- **Analogy:** Back door anyone can peek through; not recommended for production.  

### 4. SMTP â€“ Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- **Port:** TCP 25  
- **Use:** Send email between servers or from device â†’ server.  
- **Analogy:** Mailroom for outgoing letters.  

### 5. DNS â€“ Domain Name System
- **Port:** UDP 53  
- **Use:** Converts domain names to IP addresses.  
- **Analogy:** Hotel receptionist giving room numbers to guests.  

### 6. DHCP â€“ Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- **Ports:** UDP 67 (server), UDP 68 (client)  
- **Use:** Automatically assigns IP address, subnet, gateway, DNS. Supports leases and reservations.  
- **Analogy:** Front desk giving temporary or permanent room keys to guests.  

### 7. HTTP / HTTPS
- **HTTP Port:** TCP 80 (unencrypted)  
- **HTTPS Port:** TCP 443 (encrypted)  
- **Use:** Web browsing or application communication.  
- **Analogy:** Lobby = HTTP, VIP secure lounge = HTTPS.  

### 8. POP3 â€“ Post Office Protocol v3
- **Port:** TCP 110  
- **Use:** Download emails from server to client.  
- **Analogy:** Picking up mail from hotel mailbox.  

### 9. IMAP4 â€“ Internet Message Access Protocol v4
- **Port:** TCP 143  
- **Use:** Access/manage emails directly on server; syncs across multiple devices.  
- **Analogy:** Guests can check mailbox from room, lobby, or phone.  

### 10. SMB â€“ Server Message Block
- **Ports:** UDP 137, TCP 139, TCP 445  
- **Use:** File & printer sharing (Windows).  
- **Analogy:** Shared hotel kitchen/printer room accessible by multiple guests.  

### 11. SNMP â€“ Simple Network Management Protocol
- **Ports:** UDP 161 (queries), UDP 162 (traps)  
- **Use:** Monitor and manage network devices.  
- **Analogy:** Hotel manager checking stats like occupancy, energy use, alerts.  

### 12. LDAP â€“ Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
- **Port:** TCP 389  
- **Use:** Store and retrieve directory info (users/devices).  
- **Analogy:** Hotel directory listing all guests and rooms.  

### 13. RDP â€“ Remote Desktop Protocol
- **Port:** TCP 3389  
- **Use:** Remote desktop access or application sharing.  
- **Analogy:** Controlling room lights/TV from another location.

## Key Points to Remember
- Ports are **standardized** (well-known) for consistency.  
- Services can run on non-standard ports, but may cause **confusion or firewall blocks**.  
- Use **IP â†’ Port â†’ Service â†’ Analogy** to visualize and memorize functionality.

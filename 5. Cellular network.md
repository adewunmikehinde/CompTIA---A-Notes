# 📘 CompTIA A+ – Cellular Networks

## 📱 Basics
- **Cell Phones**: Operate in *cells* (coverage areas served by antennas).  
- Each cell is assigned frequencies for communication.  

---

## 📡 2G Networks
- **GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication)**: Uses TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access).  
- **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**: Multiple users share the same frequency with unique codes.  

**Features:**
- Good for voice calls.  
- Limited data (SMS, MMS).  

---

## 📡 3G Networks (1998 →)
- **Standards**: UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System).  
- **Improvements**: Packet switching for better internet.  
- **Typical speeds**: 200 Kbps – few Mbps.  
- **Uses**: Mobile TV, video on demand, web browsing.  

---

## 📡 4G / LTE
- **LTE = Long Term Evolution** → 4G standard.  
- **Speed**:  
  - Standard LTE → up to **150 Mbps**  
  - LTE-A (Advanced) → up to **300 Mbps**  
- **Technology**:  
  - OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing).  
  - All-IP network → **VoLTE (Voice over LTE)**.  

---

## 📡 5G Networks (2020 →)
- **Performance**:  
  - Much faster speeds.  
  - Extremely low latency (~1ms).  
- **Uses**:  
  - Internet of Things (IoT).  
  - AR/VR, self-driving cars, remote surgery.  
- **Frequencies**: Uses *millimeter wave (mmWave)* for ultra-high speed, shorter range.  
- **Deployment modes**: Standalone (SA) & Non-Standalone (NSA).  

---

## 🔑 Cellular Terms
- **SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)**: Identifies subscribers, stores IMSI.  
- **IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)**: Unique ID for the device hardware.  
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)**: Unique ID tied to the SIM.  
- **Baseband Radio Processor**: Handles communication with the cellular network.  
- **PRL (Preferred Roaming List)**: Ensures device connects to correct towers when roaming.  

---

## 🌐 Connectivity Features
- **Hotspot**: Turns phone into Wi-Fi router, sharing cellular data with multiple devices.  
- **Tethering**: Shares data with a single device via USB/Bluetooth.

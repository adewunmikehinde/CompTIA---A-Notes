# Wireless Network Technologies – Lesson 14  

## 802.11 Technologies (Wi-Fi)  

Wi-Fi works using **radio waves** to transmit data between devices and the router.  
The key concepts are **frequency, channels, and regulations**.  

---

### 📡 Frequency  
Wi-Fi signals use specific frequency bands (measured in **GHz**):  

- **2.4 GHz**  
  - ✅ Long range (travels farther).  
  - ✅ Better at passing through walls/obstacles.  
  - ❌ Slower speeds compared to 5 GHz.  
  - ❌ More interference (used by Bluetooth, microwaves, etc.).  

- **5 GHz**  
  - ✅ Higher speeds (streaming, gaming, video calls).  
  - ✅ Less interference, more available space.  
  - ❌ Shorter range, weak at penetrating walls.  

- **6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E)**  
  - ✅ Ultra-fast speeds, designed for modern devices.  
  - ✅ Lots of available capacity (less crowded).  
  - ❌ Very short range, works best close to the router.  

**Summary:**  
- 2.4 GHz → better distance, less speed.  
- 5 GHz → faster, shorter distance.  
- 6 GHz → super fast, short range, future-ready.

### 🛣️ Channels  
Each frequency band is split into **channels** (like lanes on a road).  

- **2.4 GHz**  
  - 11–14 channels (depends on country).  
  - Most channels **overlap**, causing interference.  
  - Only **channels 1, 6, and 11** are non-overlapping → best to use.  

- **5 GHz**  
  - Many more channels (23+ non-overlapping).  
  - Much less interference than 2.4 GHz.  

- **6 GHz**  
  - Over 50 non-overlapping channels.  
  - Designed for high-performance, low-interference Wi-Fi.  

**Summary:**  
- Channels = lanes.  
- Non-overlapping channels = smoother connections.

### 📜 Regulations  
Even though Wi-Fi uses **unlicensed spectrum**, governments still control usage.  

- Regulations cover:  
  - ✅ Which channels are allowed.  
  - ✅ Maximum power output of routers.  
  - ✅ Preventing interference with other services (e.g., radar).  

- **Examples:**  
  - U.S. → **FCC** (Federal Communications Commission).  
  - Europe → **ETSI** (European Telecommunications Standards Institute).  
  - Other countries have their own regulators.  

**Summary:**  
- Regulations = traffic laws of Wi-Fi.  
- Ensure fair use, prevent interference, and protect other services.

## ✅ Quick Recap  

- **Frequency**  
  - 2.4 GHz = long range, slow, crowded.  
  - 5 GHz = faster, short range.  
  - 6 GHz = super fast, very short range.  

- **Channels**  
  - 2.4 GHz → 3 non-overlapping (1, 6, 11).  
  - 5 GHz & 6 GHz → many non-overlapping, less interference.  

- **Regulations**  
  - Power limits, spectrum use, interference control.  
  - Different per country.

# Wireless Network Standards

Wireless networking is based on the **IEEE 802.11 standard**, managed by the **IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802)**.  
- The **Wi-Fi trademark** is managed by the **Wi-Fi Alliance**, which certifies devices for interoperability.  
- Over the years, Wi-Fi has evolved into faster, more efficient, and more reliable standards.

## Evolution of Wi-Fi Standards

### 802.11a (1999)
- **Frequency:** 5 GHz  
- **Max Speed:** 54 Mbps  
- **Range:** Shorter (signals absorbed by walls/objects)  
- **Notes:** Expensive at launch, limited adoption. Now obsolete.  

### 802.11b (1999)
- **Frequency:** 2.4 GHz  
- **Max Speed:** 11 Mbps  
- **Range:** Better than 802.11a, but interference from microwaves, Bluetooth, etc.  
- **Notes:** First widely used Wi-Fi in homes. Obsolete.  

### 802.11g (2003)
- **Frequency:** 2.4 GHz  
- **Max Speed:** 54 Mbps  
- **Backward compatible** with 802.11b  
- **Notes:** Spread Wi-Fi adoption globally. Rarely used today.

### 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) â€“ 2009
- **Frequencies:** 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz  
- **Channel Widths:** 20 / 40 MHz  
- **Max Speed:** Up to 600 Mbps (with 4 antennas at 40 MHz)  
- **Key Feature:** MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) â†’ multiple antennas for better throughput  
- **Impact:** Major leap forward, still found in budget devices  

#### ðŸ“¶ Channel Width Concept (Introduced in Wi-Fi 4)
Think of Wi-Fi channels as **lanes on a road**:
- **20 MHz channel = 1 lane road** â†’ limited cars (data) pass at a time  
- **40 MHz channel = 2 lane road** â†’ more cars can pass â†’ faster  

ðŸ‘‰ But wider lanes (40 MHz) take more space. In crowded neighborhoods (apartments, offices), this can cause **interference** (like overlapping roads).

### 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) â€“ 2013/2014
- **Frequency:** 5 GHz only  
- **Channel Widths:** 20 / 40 / 80 / 160 MHz  
- **Max Speed:** Up to ~3.5 Gbps aggregate  
- **Features:**  
  - MU-MIMO (downlink) â†’ multiple users served at once  
  - Beamforming â†’ directs signal toward devices  
  - Wider channels (super highways) for more speed  
- **Analogy:** Wi-Fi 5 gave us 4-lane and 8-lane **superhighways**  
- **Notes:** Still very common in modern routers

### 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) â€“ 2019/2020
- **Frequencies:** 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E also adds 6 GHz)  
- **Channel Widths:** 20 / 40 / 80 / 160 / 80+80 MHz  
- **Max Speed:** Up to 9.6 Gbps aggregate  
- **Features:**  
  - OFDMA (splits one wide lane into mini-lanes â†’ multiple devices share efficiently)  
  - Uplink & Downlink MU-MIMO (devices talk both ways at once)  
  - Target Wake Time (TWT) â†’ saves battery for IoT & mobile devices  
  - Handles high-density environments (stadiums, apartments, offices)  
- **Analogy:** Wi-Fi 6 is like having **super highways with smart traffic lights**. Even if crowded, cars move smoothly

### Wi-Fi 6E (Extension of 802.11ax) â€“ 2021
- **Frequencies:** 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz  
- **Speed:** Same as Wi-Fi 6 (9.6 Gbps)  
- **Key Benefit:** 6 GHz band â†’ much more spectrum, less interference  
- **Notes:** Supported in newer devices; depends on regulatory approval in each country  

---

### 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) â€“ Coming 2024â€“2025
- **Frequencies:** 2.4, 5, 6 GHz  
- **Max Speed:** Up to ~46 Gbps theoretical  
- **Features:**  
  - 320 MHz channels (double Wi-Fi 6)  
  - Multi-Link Operation (MLO) â†’ devices use multiple bands at once  
  - Improved MU-MIMO and OFDMA efficiency  
- **Notes:** Next-generation Wi-Fi, not yet fully deployed

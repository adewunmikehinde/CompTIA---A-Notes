# Network Devices – Detailed Notes

## 1. Router
**Definition:** A router is a device that connects multiple networks and directs data packets to their destinations based on IP addresses.

**Functions:**
- Routes traffic between different networks or subnets.
- Determines the best path for data using routing tables.
- Connects different network types: LAN, WLAN, fiber, copper.
- Sometimes incorporated into Layer 3 switches.

**Example:** Home Wi-Fi router connecting devices to the internet.

## 2. Switch
**Definition:** A switch connects devices within a network and forwards data to the correct destination using MAC addresses.

**Functions:**
- Provides hardware-based bridging using ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits).
- Core component in enterprise networks (CPE – Customer Premises Equipment).
- Can supply Power over Ethernet (PoE) to connected devices.

**Types of Switches:**
1. **Unmanaged Switch**
   - Plug-and-play device.
   - Fixed configuration, minimal setup.
   - No VLAN or traffic management support.
2. **Managed Switch**
   - Supports VLANs and 802.1Q interconnect.
   - Traffic prioritization (e.g., voice gets higher priority).
   - Supports redundancy with protocols like STP.
   - Can mirror ports to capture network traffic.
   - Supports management via SNMP.
3. **Multilayer Switch**
   - Includes routing capabilities, bridging Layer 2 and Layer 3 functions.

## 3. Access Point (AP)
**Definition:** A wireless access point allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.

**Functions:**
- Extends the wired network to wireless devices.
- Forwards traffic based on MAC addresses.
- Wireless router = Router + Access Point in one device.

**Example:** Wi-Fi AP in offices or homes.

## 4. Patch Panel
**Definition:** Organizes and connects network cables from workstations to network switches.

**Functions:**
- Combines punch-down blocks and RJ-45 connectors.
- Permanent cabling runs are connected once to the patch panel.
- Simplifies network changes by patching cables to different switch ports.
- No special tools required beyond a punch-down tool.

---

## 5. Firewall
**Definition:** Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic for security.

**Functions:**
- Filters traffic by port numbers (Layer 4 – TCP/UDP) or by application (Layer 7).
- Encrypts and proxies traffic if needed.
- Protects networks from external threats.
- Typically placed at network egress points.

**Note:** Many modern firewalls also function as Layer 3 routers.

## 6. Power over Ethernet (PoE)
**Definition:** Allows both data and electrical power to be delivered over the same Ethernet cable.

**Functions:**
- Powers devices like IP phones, cameras, and access points.
- Eliminates the need for separate power cables in hard-to-reach locations.

**Types:**
| Type | Standard | Year | Power | Max Current |
|------|---------|------|-------|------------|
| PoE  | 802.3af | 2003 | 15.4W | 350mA |
| PoE+ | 802.3at | 2009 | 25.5W | 680mA |
| PoE++| 802.3bt | 2018 | 51–71.3W | 600–960mA |

**Devices:** Powered through PoE switches or injectors (midspans/endspans).

## 7. Hub
**Definition:** A hub is a simple networking device that repeats data to all connected devices.

**Functions:**
- Multi-port repeater.
- Sends incoming data to every port (half-duplex).
- Inefficient as traffic increases due to collisions.

**Speed:** Typically 10/100 Mbps.  
**Note:** Largely obsolete; replaced by switches.

## 8. Modems
### Cable Modem
- Connects homes to the internet via cable TV lines.
- Uses DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) standards.
- Supports multiple services: data, voice, video.
- Speeds up to 1 Gbps in modern networks.

### DSL Modem
- Connects homes via telephone lines (ADSL – Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line).
- Download speed higher than upload (asymmetric).
- Distance-limited (~10,000 ft from central office).
- Example speeds: 52 Mbps downstream / 16 Mbps upstream.

### ONT (Optical Network Terminal)
- Converts fiber optic internet to copper-based networks in a building.
- Acts as the demarcation point between ISP responsibility and customer network.
- Typically mounted on the side of a building or inside a data center.

## 9. NIC (Network Interface Card)
**Definition:** A hardware component that allows a device to connect to a network.

**Functions:**
- Present in all networked devices: computers, servers, printers, phones, cameras.
- Connects via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or fiber.
- Can be built-in on the motherboard or added as an expansion card.

**Types:** Single-port, multi-port, copper, or fiber connections.

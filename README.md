# CompTIA---A-Notes
My learning notes while studying CompTIA A+ with Professor Messer.

This repository contains my notes and study resources while preparing for the **CompTIA A+ certification**.  
I’m using Professor Messer’s free course on YouTube, and documenting my journey here.  

✍️ Notes are written in my own words for better understanding.

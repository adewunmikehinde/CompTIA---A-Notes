# ðŸ“˜ CompTIA A+ Notes â€” Introduction to IP

This note explains **IP (Internet Protocol)** in simple terms, compares **TCP vs UDP**, shows how **ports and multiplexing** work, and includes a **basic Packet Tracer lab** with screenshots.

## 1. What is IP?

Think of IP like a **postal delivery system**:

- Every house has an **address** â†’ Every device has an **IP address**.  
- The **roads** are the **network topology** (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, DSL, etc).  
- The **truck** is the **IP protocol** carrying the data.  
- The **boxes inside the truck** are the **data packets** being delivered.  

âœ… IPâ€™s job: move data from one IP address to another.

---

## 2. Encapsulation

When data is sent, itâ€™s wrapped in layers (like nesting boxes):
- **Data** â†’ the content you want to send.  
- **TCP/UDP** â†’ Transport layer (decides reliability or speed).  
- **IP** â†’ Network layer (addressing, delivery).  
- **Ethernet** â†’ Data Link layer (local delivery by MAC address).  
- **Physical Medium** â†’ Cables or Wi-Fi.  

---

## 3. TCP vs UDP (Transport Layer)

Both TCP and UDP ride **inside IP**. They are Layer 4 protocols.

### ðŸ”¹ TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Connection-oriented (like a phone call).  
- Reliable â†’ acknowledgements, retransmissions, ordering.  
- Flow control â†’ receiver can manage speed.  
- **Examples:** HTTPS, SSH, FTP, SMTP.  

### ðŸ”¹ UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Connectionless (like a radio broadcast).  
- No guarantee of delivery â†’ no ACK, no error recovery.  
- Faster, lightweight, used for real-time.  
- **Examples:** DNS, DHCP, VoIP, online gaming.  

---

## 4. Why UDP vs TCP?

- **UDP**: Good for speed and real-time (voice/video calls, DNS lookups).  
- **TCP**: Good for reliability (web traffic, banking, file transfers).  

---

## 5. Ports and Multiplexing

IP delivers packets to the **right device**.  
Ports deliver packets to the **right application** *on that device*.  

- **Well-known ports (non-ephemeral):**  
  - Port 80 â†’ HTTP  
  - Port 443 â†’ HTTPS  
  - Port 22 â†’ SSH  
  - Port 53 â†’ DNS  

- **Client ephemeral ports (temporary, assigned by OS):**  
  - Range: `1024â€“65535`  
  - Used to keep multiple connections active at once.  

### ðŸ”¹ Multiplexing
Multiplexing = one computer can use **many connections at the same time**:  
- Browser session on port 443  
- SSH session on port 22  
- DNS request on port 53  

---

## 6. Other Protocols Encapsulated in IP

Besides TCP and UDP, IP also carries:

- **ICMP** â†’ diagnostics (e.g., `ping`).  
- **IGMP** â†’ multicast streaming.  
- **ESP/AH (IPSec)** â†’ VPN encryption.  

---

## 7. Protocol Examples

**UDP-based**
- DHCP â†’ assigns IP addresses.  
- DNS â†’ resolves names to IPs.  
- TFTP â†’ lightweight file transfer.  

**TCP-based**
- HTTPS â†’ secure web traffic.  
- SSH â†’ secure remote login.  
- FTP â†’ file transfer.

# ðŸ§ª Basic Lab Practical â€” Introduction to IP

We will test IP using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

---

## Lab Objective
- Configure 2 PCs in the same subnet.  
- Test connectivity using `ping`.  
- Observe packets in Simulation Mode.  
- Show failure with wrong subnetting.

## Lab Topology

## ðŸ§ª Basic Lab Practical â€” Introduction to IP

### Lab Topology

PC0 (192.168.1.10) ---- Switch2960 ---- PC1 (192.168.1.20)

ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot:* `screenshots/topology_basic.png`

---

### Step 1 â€” Device Setup
- Add **PC0**, **PC1**, and a **2960 Switch**.  
- Connect with **Copper Straight-Through cables**.  

ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot:* `screenshots/topology_basic.png`

---

### Step 2 â€” IP Addressing
- **PC0**: `192.168.1.10 / 255.255.255.0`  
- **PC1**: `192.168.1.20 / 255.255.255.0`  

ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot:* `screenshots/pc0_ipconfig.png`  
ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot:* `screenshots/pc1_ipconfig.png`

---

### Step 3 â€” Testing (Realtime Mode)
On **PC0**, open Command Prompt and run:

```bash
ipconfig
ping 192.168.1.20

ðŸ“¸ Screenshot: screenshots/pc0_ipconfig_cmd.png
ðŸ“¸ Screenshot: screenshots/ping_success_basic.png


---

Step 4 â€” Simulation Mode

Switch to Simulation Mode.

Open Event List Filters â†’ IPv4 â†’ select only ICMP.

Run ping 192.168.1.20.

Observe ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply.

Step 5 â€” Failure Case

Change PC1 to: 192.168.2.20 / 255.255.255.0

From PC0, run:


ping 192.168.2.20

Packets leave PC0 but never return (wrong subnet).

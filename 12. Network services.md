# ðŸ“˜ Network Services

Network services are specialized systems that provide resources, applications, and management across a network. They are critical for communication, security, and resource sharing.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ DNS (Domain Name System)
- Converts domain names (e.g., `google.com`) into IP addresses and vice versa.  
- Distributed naming system â†’ prevents overload on a single server.  
- Managed by ISPs or enterprise IT.  
- **Critical resource** for internet functionality.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Automatically assigns:
  - IP addresses
  - Subnet masks
  - Gateways
  - DNS servers
- Saves time vs. manual configuration.  
- Common on **home routers**.  
- In enterprises, runs on **redundant central servers** for reliability.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ File Server
- Centralized storage for files (documents, videos, pictures, etc.).  
- Allows **file sharing** across users/devices.  
- Protocols:  
  - **SMB (Server Message Block)** â†’ Windows  
  - **AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)** â†’ Mac  
- End-users just see standard file operations (copy, delete, rename).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Print Server
- Provides printing services for network devices.  
- May be:  
  - Software on a computer (with the printer attached), OR  
  - Built into the printer (network-enabled).  
- Protocols:  
  - **SMB (Server Message Block)**  
  - **IPP (Internet Printing Protocol)**  
  - **LPD (Line Printer Daemon)**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Mail Server
- Stores **incoming mail** and sends **outgoing mail**.  
- Managed by ISPs or enterprise IT.  
- Must run **24/7** (mission-critical service).  
- Complex due to security, spam filtering, and storage needs.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Syslog
- **Standard for log messages** across devices.  
- Collects logs from routers, switches, servers, firewalls, etc.  
- Stored in a **central log server**.  
- Works with **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**.  
- Needs **large storage** for logs.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Web Server
- Responds to browser requests using **HTTP/HTTPS**.  
- Hosts content:  
  - **Static pages** â†’ prebuilt HTML.  
  - **Dynamic pages** â†’ generated in real-time (PHP, ASP.NET, etc.).  
- Delivers pages from server â†’ browser.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Authentication Server
- Centralized login/authentication service.  
- Used for access control to resources.  
- Enterprise-only (not needed for home networks).  
- Uses **redundant servers** for availability.  
- Examples: **Active Directory, RADIUS, TACACS+**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Spam & Spam Gateways
- **Spam** = unsolicited emails (ads, phishing, scams).  
- Problems: wasted storage, wasted security resources, user risk.  
- **Spam Gateways**: filter/block spam before reaching users.  
- Can be on-site or cloud-based.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ All-in-One Security Appliance (UTM)
- **Unified Threat Management (UTM)** device.  
- Combines multiple security features:  
  - Firewall, IDS/IPS  
  - Email & content filtering  
  - Malware & spam detection  
  - VPN endpoint  
  - Bandwidth shaping  
  - SSL inspection & DLP (Data Loss Prevention)  
- Provides centralized **network security**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Load Balancer
- Distributes client requests across multiple servers.  
- **Invisible to end-users**.  
- Provides **fault tolerance** (if one server fails, traffic is rerouted).  
- Used in **web farms, database farms**.  
- Features:  
  - SSL offload (encryption/decryption handled by balancer)  
  - TCP offload (reduces server workload)  
  - Caching for faster response  
  - Prioritization & QoS  
  - Application-aware distribution  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Proxy Server
- Acts as an **intermediate server** between client and the internet.  
- Flow: Client â†’ Proxy â†’ Internet â†’ Proxy â†’ Client.  
- Uses:  
  - **Caching** (faster browsing)  
  - **Access control** (restrict sites)  
  - **URL filtering**  
  - **Content scanning** (malware/security)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ SCADA / ICS (Industrial Control Systems)
- **SCADA** = Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition.  
- Controls **large-scale industrial systems**:  
  - Power plants  
  - Oil refineries  
  - Manufacturing plants  
  - Logistics  
- Provides **real-time monitoring & control**.  
- Requires strict **network segmentation** (must not be exposed to the internet).  
- Part of broader **ICS (Industrial Control Systems)**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Legacy & Embedded Systems
- **Legacy systems**: outdated but still critical (e.g., old databases, factory controllers).  
- **Embedded systems**: purpose-built devices (alarms, security doors, time card systems).  
- Typically limited OS access but still need strong security.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ IoT (Internet of Things) Devices
- Internet-connected everyday devices.  
- Examples: smart fridges, speakers, thermostats, doorbells, CCTV.  
- Often insecure â†’ require **network segmentation**.  
- Security risk: IoT compromise can allow attackers into the network.
